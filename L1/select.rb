# Write a select method that mirrors the behavior of Array#select.
# Note that the Array#select method takes a block, then yields each element to
# the block. If the block evaluates to true, the current element will be included
# in the returned array. If the block evaluates to false, the current element
# will not be included in the returned array.

def select(arr)
  result = []
  arr.each do |i|
    response = !!yield(i)
    response ? result << i : next
  end
  result
end




array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

 p select(array) { |num| num.odd? }      # => [1, 3, 5]
 p select(array) { |num| puts num }      # => [], because "puts num" returns nil and evaluates to false
 p select(array) { |num| num + 1 }       # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], because "num + 1" evaluates to true
